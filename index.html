                        1. John 4:21–24
Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father. 
You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews. 
But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth,
 for the Father is seeking such people to worship him. God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”

                        2. Romans 12:1–2
I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, 
holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world,
 but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, 
that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

                        3. Psalm 63:1–4
O God, you are my God; earnestly I seek you;
      my soul thirsts for you;
my flesh faints for you,
      as in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
So I have looked upon you in the sanctuary,
      beholding your power and glory.
Because your steadfast love is better than life,
      my lips will praise you.
So I will bless you as long as I live;
      in your name I will lift up my hands.

                        4. Exodus 20:1–6
                        And God spoke all these words, saying,
                              “I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.
                              “You shall have no other gods before me.
                              “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, 
                              or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, 
                              or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, 
                              visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, 
                              but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.”
